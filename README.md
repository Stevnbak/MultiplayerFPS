# MultiplayerFPS
A multiplayer first person shooter project.

This is just a basic test for me to experiment with multiplayer and networking in a FPS. 
For the networking I'm using [Riptide Networking](https://riptide.tomweiland.net/), which is a low level package for handling sending messages between clients and the server. What information is being sent and when is being handled by the game itself and not the package which gives me more control and understanding of what needs to happen.
It is fully not complete yet, but does have the most basic functionalities mostly working like connection, movement, shooting, killing, respawning multiple lobbies etc. and I'm still working on it every now and then.
