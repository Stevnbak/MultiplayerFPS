# MultiplayerFPS
A multiplayer first person shooter game. Currently in development.

This is just a basic test for me to experiment with multiplayer and networking in Unity. 
I'm using [Riptide Networking](https://riptide.tomweiland.net/), a low level package for handling sending messages between clients and the server. What information is being sent and when I'm handling myself which gives me more control but also makes it more complicated.
It is not complete yet, but does have the most basic functionalities mostly working and I'm still working on it every now and then.

## Development
The game is being developed in Unity using C#. The networking is being done using Riptide Networking, a low level package for handling sending messages between clients and the server.
